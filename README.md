# Tobacco-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to detect tobacco leaf diseases such as Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), Frog Eye Leaf Spot, and Powdery Mildew.
The system leverages image classification techniques (CNN + traditional ML models) to identify whether a tobacco leaf is healthy or diseased.
By deploying this model in a mobile/web application, farmers can capture/upload images of leaves and receive real-time, accurate disease diagnosis — even in low-connectivity rural areas.

🎯 Goals
Create a high-quality, labeled dataset of healthy and diseased tobacco leaves.
Train and evaluate ML models to achieve ≥85% accuracy in real-world conditions.
Deploy the best-performing model into a lightweight farmer-friendly application.
Provide an accessible, offline-capable solution for rural farmers.

📦 Deliverables
📂 Labeled dataset of tobacco leaf images.
🤖 Trained CNN and baseline ML models (SVM, KNN, RF).
📱 Functional prototype mobile/web application.
📊 Evaluation reports (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score).
📝 User testing & feedback reports.

🚀 Tech Stack
Machine Learning: Python, TensorFlow / PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV
App Development: Flask / Django (backend), React / React Native (frontend)
Data Management: Pandas, NumPy
Project Management: Trello, GitHub, Jira
